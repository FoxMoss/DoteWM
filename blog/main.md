# How I Snuck A Web Browser Into My X11 Window Manager

This is an image of my window manager with full X11 support as well as border decorations,
background, and window interactions be handled by a web browser.

Let me explain.

The idea came after being tangentially involved in the WebOS space for a while. Projects like
[puter](https://puter.com/) and [AnuraOS](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/anuraOS) which aim to
bring a operating system like experience to the web. They have many subprojects inside, as you could
probably assume, but the first thing most projects have down is a window manager. Something that
lets users drag around iframes and resize them. This probably comes from the conflation of window
manager with an operating system in ecosystems where the line is less clear like in Windows and
MacOS. Most users just conflate that experience with just being how an operating system works and
you can't decouple them. What's interesting is that you very quickly begin to realize how complex and
how much variety these systems have when you write them from scratch. So my pitch is why keep these
projects in the space of the web browser, give them purpose, give them life!
